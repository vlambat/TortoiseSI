<h1 id="section1">Overview of TortoiseSI</h1>
<p>TortoiseSI is a free, open-source Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; shell extension client for PTC Integrity. </p>
<p>PTC Integrity is a cross-platform, enterprise-class software configuration management and versioning solution. </p>
<p>TortoiseSI  exposes PTC Integrity views, source commands, and version-controlled member actions on Windows files and folders through Windows Explorer. </p>

<h2 id="section1_1">What You Can Do With TortoiseSI</h2>
<p>TortoiseSI offers you a light-weight open-source interface to perform various Integrity operations, access Integrity data views, and commit changes to the repository. TortoiseSI displays <a href="#section6_2">icon overlays</a> in Windows Explorer to indicate working file status on the file system.</p>

<h2 id="section1_2">Who is this Guide For?</h2>
<p>This guide is intended for anyone interested in accessing Integrity views and performing Integrity operations directly from the Windows Explorer interface.</p>
<p>Since TortoiseSI is a Windows shell extension, this documentation assumes that the user is familiar with and proficient at using Microsoft Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>Developers who are interested in getting involved with the TortoiseSI project can refer to the <a href="https://github.com/PTC-ALM/TortoiseSI/wiki">GitHub TortoiseSI wiki</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section1_3">TortoiseSI Context Menu</h2>
<p>TortoiseSI commands are available from the Windows Explorer context menu, and they are visible when you right-click on a file, folder, or subfolder. The TortoiseSI context menu commands update dynamically based on selection context. </p>
<p><img src="images/TortoiseSIContextMenu.png" alt="TortoiseSI Context Menu" /></p>
<p>You can also see the TortoiseSI menu as part of the Windows Explorer File menu.</p>


<h1 id="section2">Installing and Configuring TortoiseSI</h1>
<h2 id="section2_1">TortoiseSI Installation Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
  <li>PTC Integrity Client version 10.7 or later is required for TortoiseSI. Once TortoiseSI is installed, the  client starts automatically when Windows starts up.</li>
  <ul>
  <li>HotFix HF-S140000000-003 is required for Integrity Client 10.7 customers using TortoiseSI. This HotFix forces Integrity's Working File Changes view to refresh after a non-transactional change package is submitted. For more information, contact PTC - Integrity Support through the <a href="http://www.ptc.com/support/integrity.htm">Integrity Support Center</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>TortoiseSI supports the same Windows platforms that are supported by  the Integrity client. For details on supported platforms, refer to the <a href="http://www.ptc.com/partners/hardware/current/support.htm">PTC Integrity Product Platforms</a> documentation available through the <a href="http://www.ptc.com/support/integrity.htm">Integrity Support Center</a>.</li>
  <li>TortoiseSI only supports files located on fixed local drives. Optical drives, network drives, and mass storage devices are not supported.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you encounter any problems while installing TortoiseSI, or following a TortoiseSI install, please refer to the <a href="#section2_6">Troubleshooting Tips</a> section in this document first before <a href="#section7">contacting us</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section2_2">Installing TortoiseSI</h2>
<p>TortoiseSI comes with a straightforward Setup Wizard installer. Double-click on the installer file and follow the instructions. The installer takes care of the rest.</p>
<p>To download a TortoiseSI release build:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In a browser, navigate to the <a href="http://www.TortoiseSI.org">TortoiseSI GitHub project page</a>.</li>
  <li>In the <b>Downloads</b> section, click to download the TortoiseSI install for your operating system platform.</li>
  <li>Run the downloaded TortoiseSI MSI installer and proceed through the Setup Wizard.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section2_4">Updating TortoiseSI</h2>
<p>You can install a newer  version of TortoiseSI directly on top of an existing installation. You do not need to uninstall your current TortoiseSI application first.</p>

<h2 id="section2_5">Verifying a Successful Installation</h2>
<p>Once TortoiseSI is installed on the system, you can verify that the install was successful by creating a sandbox in Integrity.</p>
<Ol>
  <li>Using Windows Explorer, navigate to a folder on the file system.</li>
  <li>Right-click on the folder and select the <b>TortoiseSI &gt; Create Sandbox</b> option.<br /><br />
    <img src="images/TortoiseSIRightClickOption.png" alt="TortoiseSI Right-Click Option" /></li>
  <li>When prompted, connect to an Integrity server with valid credentials.</li>
  <li>When prompted, create a sandbox using Integrity's Create Sandbox Wizard. For details on creating sandboxes in Integrity, see the <em>PTC Integrity User Guide</em>, <em>Integrity Help Center</em>, or <em>Integrity CLI man pages.</em></li>
</Ol>

<h2 id="section2_6">Troubleshooting Tips</h2>
<h3 id="section2_6_1">Connecting to Integrity Server</h3>
<p>TortoiseSI automatically connects to an Integrity server. The specific server is based on your Integrity client preferences. </p>
<p>If you are not prompted to connect to  Integrity, verify that the  client is running, and that the client application can communicate with an Integrity server.</p>
<p>If TortoiseSI loses its connection to the  server, TortoiseSI will work silently in offline mode. To force a connection to the  server, perform an operation that requires a server connection, such as viewing a sandbox through  Integrity's Sandbox view.</p>

<h3 id="section2_6_2">No Icon Overlays</h3>
<p>If you are unable to see the TortoiseSI <a href="#section6_2">icon overlays</a> on files and folders in Windows Explorer, restart Windows Explorer or reboot the machine.</p>

<h3 id="section2_6_3">Unsupported File System Locations</h3>
<p>TortoiseSI only supports files located on fixed local drives.</p>
<p>File locations that are not supported by TortoiseSI include optical drives, network drives, and mass storage devices. If a file location is not supported, the <a href="#section1_3">TortoiseSI context menu</a> is not visible in Windows Explorer.</p>

<h3 id="section2_6_4">Multiple Integrity Clients Installed</h3>
<p>If you have more than one Integrity client installed on the machine, TortoiseSI uses the first  client on the PATH environment variable. For more information on debugging non-standard configurations, such as running multiple  clients, see the <a href="https://github.com/PTC-ALM/TortoiseSI/wiki">GitHub TortoiseSI wiki</a>.</p>

<h3 id="section2_6_5">No Integrity Client Installed</h3>
<p>If TortoiseSI cannot find a client in the PATH environment variable, the TortoiseSI context menu is not visible in Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>If the Integrity client is uninstalled after TortoiseSI has been installed, the TortoiseSI context menu is visible, but a client communication error displays when you try to perform a TortoiseSI operation. Restart the Explorer.exe process or reboot the machine to hide the TortoiseSI context menu in Windows Explorer. </p>

<h1 id="section3">Managing Integrity Sandboxes with TortoiseSI</h1>
<h2 id="section3_1">Sandbox Overview</h2>
<p>Using TortoiseSI, you can perform a number of Integrity sandbox operations. </p>
<p>An Integrity sandbox is a local pointer to an Integrity project residing on the Integrity server. </p>
<p>On the file system, a sandbox  functions as a mirror image of a version-controlled Integrity SCM (software configuration management) project. Each Integrity sandbox is actually a collection of pointers to files in the master project. Integrity sandboxes allow you to work locally in your own workspace, without interfering with the work of others.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Where applicable, TortoiseSI commands launch additional Integrity commands, dialogs, and workflows. Integrity operations follow configured Integrity client preferences.</p>

<h2 id="section3_2">TortoiseSI Sandbox Operations</h2>
<p>The following Integrity sandbox operations are available using TortoiseSI. The equivalent Integrity command is listed for each supported TortoiseSI sandbox operation.</p>
<p>For information on Integrity sandbox operations, Integrity commands, or Integrity client preferences, see the <em>PTC Integrity User Guide</em>, <em>Integrity Help Center</em>, or <em>Integrity CLI man pages</em>.</p>

<h1 id="section5">Committing Changes to the Repository </h1>
<p>You can use  Integrity&rsquo;s Working File Changes view  to compare an Integrity version-controlled project against the file system.  The Working File Changes view lists all of the files, folders, and subfolders that have been added, updated, or deleted.</p>
<p>When you are ready to commit changes to the repository, right-click on an Integrity sandbox and select <b>TortoiseSI &gt; View Working File Changes</b> to access the  Working File Changes view in the  client.</p>
<p>You can also use the Working File Changes view to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move selected files to Integrity change packages.</li> 
<li>Submit selected Integrity change packages to commit those changes to the repository.</li> 
</ul>

<p>For more information on Integrity change packages and the Working File Changes view, see the <em>PTC Integrity User Guide</em> or the <em>Integrity Help Center</em>.</p>
<p><b>Notes:</b> </p>
<ul>
  <li>HotFix HF-S140000000-003 is required for Integrity Client 10.7 customers using TortoiseSI. This HotFix forces the Working File Changes view to refresh after a non-transactional change package is submitted.</li>
  <li>HotFix  HF-S140000000-001 is available for Integrity Client 10.7. This HotFix reduces the number of user prompts that are displayed when moving multiple entries to change packages using the Working File Changes view.</li>

<h2 id="section6_5">Excluding Files</h2>
<p>You can use TortoiseSI to exclude uncontrolled files in a sandbox from appearing in selections when adding members to a version-controlled Integrity project. </p>
<p>For example, you may want to  avoid adding specific DLL files or all EXE files when performing a member add operation. You do not want to have to remember to  exclude  files manually. Excluding a specific filename or a file pattern adds that exclusion as an  Integrity  Non-Member Files exclusion filter preference in the client.</p>
<ul>
  <li>To exclude a specific file by filename, right-click on a single file and select <b>TortoiseSI &gt; Add to exclude filter</b> <b>&gt; [the file you want to exclude]</b>.</li>
  <li>To exclude files by file pattern, right-click on a single file and select <b>TortoiseSI &gt; Add to exclude filter</b> <b>&gt; [file pattern]</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To remove a file pattern exclusion filter, right-click on a non-member file that currently matches a file pattern entry in the exclusion filter, and select <b>TortoiseSI &gt; Remove from Exclude Filter &gt; [file pattern]</b>.</p>
