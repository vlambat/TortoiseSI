<h1 id="section1">Overview of TortoiseSI</h1>
<p>TortoiseSI is a free, open-source Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; shell extension client for PTC Integrity. </p>
<p>PTC Integrity is a cross-platform, enterprise-class software configuration management and versioning solution. </p>
<p>TortoiseSI  exposes PTC Integrity views, source commands, and version-controlled member actions on Windows files and folders through Windows Explorer. </p>

<h2 id="section1_1">What You Can Do With TortoiseSI</h2>
<p>TortoiseSI offers you a light-weight open-source interface to perform various Integrity operations, access Integrity data views, and commit changes to the repository. TortoiseSI displays <a href="#section6_2">icon overlays</a> in Windows Explorer to indicate working file status on the file system.</p>

<h2 id="section1_2">Who is this Guide For?</h2>
<p>This guide is intended for anyone interested in accessing Integrity views and performing Integrity operations directly from the Windows Explorer interface.</p>
<p>Since TortoiseSI is a Windows shell extension, this documentation assumes that the user is familiar with and proficient at using Microsoft Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>Developers who are interested in getting involved with the TortoiseSI project can refer to the <a href="https://github.com/PTC-ALM/TortoiseSI/wiki">GitHub TortoiseSI wiki</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section1_3">TortoiseSI Context Menu</h2>
<p>TortoiseSI commands are available from the Windows Explorer context menu, and they are visible when you right-click on a file, folder, or subfolder. The TortoiseSI context menu commands update dynamically based on selection context. </p>
<p><img src="images/TortoiseSIContextMenu.png" alt="TortoiseSI Context Menu" /></p>
<p>You can also see the TortoiseSI menu as part of the Windows Explorer File menu.</p>


<h1 id="section2">Installing and Configuring TortoiseSI</h1>
<h2 id="section2_1">TortoiseSI Installation Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
  <li>PTC Integrity Client version 10.7 or greater is required for TortoiseSI. Other Integrity client versions are not supported. Once TortoiseSI is installed, the  client starts automatically when Windows starts up.</li>
  <ul>
  <li>HotFix HF-S140000000-003 is required for Integrity Client 10.7 customers using TortoiseSI. This HotFix forces Integrity's Working File Changes view to refresh after a non-transactional change package is submitted. For more information, contact PTC - Integrity Support through the <a href="http://www.ptc.com/support/integrity.htm">Integrity Support Center</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>TortoiseSI supports the same Windows platforms that are supported by  the Integrity client. For details on supported platforms, refer to the <a href="http://www.ptc.com/partners/hardware/current/support.htm">PTC Integrity Product Platforms</a> documentation available through the <a href="http://www.ptc.com/support/integrity.htm">Integrity Support Center</a>.</li>
  <li>TortoiseSI only supports files located on fixed local drives. Optical drives, network drives, and mass storage devices are not supported.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you encounter any problems while installing TortoiseSI, or following a TortoiseSI install, please refer to the <a href="#section2_6">Troubleshooting Tips</a> section in this document first before <a href="#section7">contacting us</a>.</p>

<h2 id="section2_2">Installing TortoiseSI</h2>
<p>TortoiseSI comes with a straightforward Setup Wizard installer. Double-click on the installer file and follow the instructions. The installer takes care of the rest.</p>
<p>To download a TortoiseSI release build:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In a browser, navigate to the <a href="http://www.TortoiseSI.org">TortoiseSI GitHub project page</a>.</li>
  <li>In the <b>Downloads</b> section, click to download the TortoiseSI install for your operating system platform.</li>
  <li>Run the downloaded TortoiseSI MSI installer and proceed through the Setup Wizard.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="section2_4">Updating TortoiseSI</h2>
<p>You can install a newer  version of TortoiseSI directly on top of an existing installation. You do not need to uninstall your current TortoiseSI application first.</p>

<h2 id="section2_5">Verifying a Successful Installation</h2>
<p>Once TortoiseSI is installed on the system, you can verify that the install was successful by creating a sandbox in Integrity.</p>
<Ol>
  <li>Using Windows Explorer, navigate to a folder on the file system.</li>
  <li>Right-click on the folder and select the <b>TortoiseSI &gt; Create Sandbox</b> option.<br /><br />
    <img src="images/TortoiseSIRightClickOption.png" alt="TortoiseSI Right-Click Option" /></li>
  <li>When prompted, connect to an Integrity server with valid credentials.</li>
  <li>When prompted, create a sandbox using Integrity's Create Sandbox Wizard. For details on creating sandboxes in Integrity, see the <em>PTC Integrity User Guide</em>, <em>Integrity Help Center</em>, or <em>Integrity CLI man pages.</em></li>
</Ol>

<h2 id="section2_6">Troubleshooting Tips</h2>
<h3 id="section2_6_1">Connecting to Integrity Server</h3>
<p>TortoiseSI automatically connects to an Integrity server. The specific server is based on your Integrity client preferences. </p>
<p>If you are not prompted to connect to  Integrity, verify that the  client is running, and that the client application can communicate with an Integrity server.</p>
<p>If TortoiseSI loses its connection to the  server, TortoiseSI will work silently in offline mode. To force a connection to the  server, perform an operation that requires a server connection, such as viewing a sandbox through  Integrity's Sandbox view.</p>

<h3 id="section2_6_2">No Icon Overlays</h3>
<p>If you are unable to see the TortoiseSI <a href="#section6_2">icon overlays</a> on files and folders in Windows Explorer, restart Windows Explorer or reboot the machine.</p>

<h3 id="section2_6_3">Unsupported File System Locations</h3>
<p>TortoiseSI only supports files located on fixed local drives.</p>
<p>File locations that are not supported by TortoiseSI include optical drives, network drives, and mass storage devices. If a file location is not supported, the <a href="#section1_3">TortoiseSI context menu</a> is not visible in Windows Explorer.</p>

<h3 id="section2_6_4">Multiple Integrity Clients Installed</h3>
<p>If you have more than one Integrity client installed on the machine, TortoiseSI uses the first  client on the PATH environment variable. For more information on debugging non-standard configurations, such as running multiple  clients, see the <a href="https://github.com/PTC-ALM/TortoiseSI/wiki">GitHub TortoiseSI wiki</a>.</p>

<h3 id="section2_6_5">No Integrity Client Installed</h3>
<p>If TortoiseSI cannot find a client in the PATH environment variable, the TortoiseSI context menu is not visible in Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>If the Integrity client is uninstalled after TortoiseSI has been installed, the TortoiseSI context menu is visible, but a client communication error displays when you try to perform a TortoiseSI operation. Restart the Explorer.exe process or reboot the machine to hide the TortoiseSI context menu in Windows Explorer. </p>

<h1 id="section3">Managing Integrity Sandboxes with TortoiseSI</h1>
<h2 id="section3_1">Sandbox Overview</h2>
<p>Using TortoiseSI, you can perform a number of Integrity sandbox operations. </p>
<p>An Integrity sandbox is a local pointer to an Integrity project residing on the Integrity server. </p>
<p>On the file system, a sandbox  functions as a mirror image of a version-controlled Integrity SCM (software configuration management) project. Each Integrity sandbox is actually a collection of pointers to files in the master project. Integrity sandboxes allow you to work locally in your own workspace, without interfering with the work of others.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Where applicable, TortoiseSI commands launch additional Integrity commands, dialogs, and workflows. Integrity operations follow configured Integrity client preferences.</p>

<h2 id="section3_2">TortoiseSI Sandbox Operations</h2>
<p>The following Integrity sandbox operations are available using TortoiseSI. The equivalent Integrity command is listed for each supported TortoiseSI sandbox operation.</p>
<p>For information on Integrity sandbox operations, Integrity commands, or Integrity client preferences, see the <em>PTC Integrity User Guide</em>, <em>Integrity Help Center</em>, or <em>Integrity CLI man pages</em>.</p>

<h1 id="section5">Committing Changes to the Repository </h1>
<p>You can use  Integrity&rsquo;s Working File Changes view  to compare an Integrity version-controlled project against the file system.  The Working File Changes view lists all of the files, folders, and subfolders that have been added, updated, or deleted.</p>
<p>When you are ready to commit changes to the repository, right-click on an Integrity sandbox and select <b>TortoiseSI &gt; View Working File Changes</b> to access the  Working File Changes view in the  client.</p>
<p>You can also use the Working File Changes view to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move selected files to Integrity change packages.</li> 
<li>Submit selected Integrity change packages to commit those changes to the repository.</li> 
</ul>

<p>For more information on Integrity change packages and the Working File Changes view, see the <em>PTC Integrity User Guide</em> or the <em>Integrity Help Center</em>.</p>

<h2 id="section6_5">Excluding Files</h2>
<p>You can use TortoiseSI to exclude uncontrolled files in a sandbox from appearing in selections when adding members to a version-controlled Integrity project. </p>
<p>For example, you may want to  avoid adding specific DLL files or all EXE files when performing a member add operation. You do not want to have to remember to  exclude  files manually. Excluding a specific filename or a file pattern adds that exclusion as an  Integrity  Non-Member Files exclusion filter preference in the client.</p>
<ul>
  <li>To exclude a specific file by filename, right-click on a single file and select <b>TortoiseSI &gt; Add to exclude filter</b> <b>&gt; [the file you want to exclude]</b>.</li>
  <li>To exclude files by file pattern, right-click on a single file and select <b>TortoiseSI &gt; Add to exclude filter</b> <b>&gt; [file pattern]</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To remove a file pattern exclusion filter, right-click on a non-member file that currently matches a file pattern entry in the exclusion filter, and select <b>TortoiseSI &gt; Remove from Exclude Filter &gt; [file pattern]</b>.</p>
